# Unit 19 PWA Homework: Text Editor

## Your Task

This assignment is to build a text editor that runs in the browser using the manifest plugin. This application is supposed to have a downloadable file that can then run when the user is offline.

I could not get idb installed as it shows my terminal "command not found".

I feel like I am very close to this being fully functional and I went to ASK BCS for help and was able to get my main issue solved. I will seek help from my TA in class.

## User Story
